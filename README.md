# Analysis_meliloti_sequences
You will find scripts to count the H signatures of the S. meliloti library from Pobigaylo 2006 and to normalise and analise the raw counts using DESeq 2 and glmmSEQ.

BASH scripts were developed using a template script written by Sunniva Sigurdardóttir (PhD student at Göteborgs universitet | GitHub: sunnivass) 

You will also find three tables with the information of gene name, gene ID, Protein ID, funtion. The information was collected using the Ensembl repositories by Dr. Santiago del Palacio. The script to collect the data from Ensembl is also available in this repo.

To run the BASH scripts follow the description file "RUN_Scripts_BASH_meliloti"
